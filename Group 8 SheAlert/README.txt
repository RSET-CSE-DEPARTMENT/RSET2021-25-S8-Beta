SHEALERT: VIGILANCE REDEFINED

SHEALERT: Vigilance Redefined is an AI-powered real-time surveillance solution designed to enhance women’s safety through intelligent video analysis. The system leverages advanced deep learning models to detect violent behavior and identify gender and facial expression from live camera feeds. By integrating pretrained models—final_violencne_model.keras for violence detection and gender_detection_model.keras for gender classification—SHEALERT provides proactive alerts whenever suspicious or aggressive behavior is detected, especially in male-female interactions. This helps prevent potential threats and enables quick response, offering a significant step forward in smart public safety systems.
To run SHEALERT, users need to set up the system across two devices. The client-side device processes live video using final_alert.py, analyzing frames for violence and gender using the pretrained models. The server-side device runs alert_reciever.py, which receives alerts triggered by the client and can further log or escalate them. The system is built with Python 3.9 and requires several dependencies, including deepface, tensorflow==2.11, keras==2.11, opencv-python==4.7.0.72, cvlib, matplotlib, and numpy. SHEALERT combines deep learning, real-time computer vision, and practical safety needs into a compact, deployable package for smarter surveillance.
